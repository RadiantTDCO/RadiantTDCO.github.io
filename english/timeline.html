    <section>
      <h2>2. Development Phase (December - January)</h2>
      <p>Entering the development phase was exhilarating yet intimidating. The transition from planning to actual coding marked a significant shift in my project's journey. Initially, building prototypes using Django and MongoDB was filled with excitement, discovery, and intense learning experiences. Each line of code written felt like an emotional victory, symbolizing tangible progress.</p>
      <p>However, early prototyping revealed limitations and practical challenges. Realizing that Django and MongoDB wouldn't fully meet my project's needs brought anxiety and doubt, forcing me into another difficult decision. Pivoting to PHP and MariaDB wasn't easy—it meant discarding significant work and venturing into unfamiliar territory once again.</p>
      <p>Adopting PHP and MariaDB required a fresh wave of learning, accompanied by frustration and occasional self-doubt. Yet, as I gained proficiency, each successful implementation boosted my emotional resilience, reigniting confidence and enthusiasm. Seeing the backend gradually take shape with robust database integration provided profound satisfaction and validated my decision.</p>
      <p>Designing the UI/UX became another emotional journey. Creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces demanded empathy, creativity, and meticulous attention to detail. Early designs faced criticism and required extensive revisions, initially causing emotional discouragement. However, each refinement was deeply rewarding, enhancing usability and increasing my pride in the final product.</p>
      <p>Implementing core features—login systems, patient records, and efficient data retrieval—was technically demanding yet emotionally fulfilling. Each functional feature represented meaningful progress and reinforced my motivation. Completing these core functionalities transformed my initial anxiety into powerful emotional reassurance and pride.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the development phase wasn't merely technical—it was a profound emotional journey. Each challenge faced and overcome enriched my personal growth, resilience, and confidence. This period taught me invaluable lessons about persistence, adaptability, and the emotional power of incremental progress, profoundly shaping my project's outcome and my personal journey.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Testing &amp; Refinement (January - February)</h2>
      <p>The testing and refinement phase was both rewarding and emotionally demanding. Introducing my project to real users—nurses, teachers, and students—was nerve-wracking, filled with anticipation and anxiety. I feared discovering flaws or shortcomings that might undermine months of dedicated work.</p>
      <p>Early user feedback sessions were challenging yet illuminating. Witnessing users encounter unexpected issues or struggle with specific functionalities initially felt disheartening, triggering feelings of inadequacy. Yet, I quickly recognized the immense value in these sessions. User feedback became a guiding light, revealing critical improvements necessary for real-world usability.</p>
      <p>Addressing security issues uncovered during testing was particularly intense. Discovering vulnerabilities filled me with a sense of urgency and responsibility. Resolving these security gaps required rigorous testing, careful problem-solving, and emotional resilience. Each issue resolved brought immense relief and pride, strengthening my confidence and reaffirming my commitment to delivering a secure, reliable system.</p>
      <p>Optimizing database queries and system performance presented another emotional and technical challenge. Slow responses and inefficiencies initially frustrated and overwhelmed me. Yet, each performance improvement provided emotional satisfaction, making my system smoother, faster, and more reliable. Witnessing user satisfaction as performance improved reinforced my dedication and emotional investment profoundly.</p>
      <p>Integrating speech-to-text functionality added another meaningful layer to the project. Witnessing nurses efficiently using voice input for patient records was emotionally moving and deeply validating.
